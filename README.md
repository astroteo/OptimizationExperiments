# OptimizationExperiments
Genetic training of a neural network for obstacle avoidance, in CHolessy Wiltshire Dynamic.
<br>
Neural network is used as NL estimator for trajectory generation from a point-A to a point-B in optimal (w.r.t. fuel consumption)
<br>
Current Algorithm will not work for arbitrary A-B points couple, but only with the same A-B points used in training phase.
=> => In a next phase policy-gradient reinforcement learning will be implemented
